# Statement
- So in the background I am using NLP(Natural Language Processing) and Text Vectorization such that after concatenation I can convert the data into required format to perform the operations and to get the strong positive similarity between any given data we select from the list of 5000 datasets. 
- Interface made using streamlit framework and deployed on heroku.

- And for the posters, I am using tmdb API to fetch it as per their unique ids.
